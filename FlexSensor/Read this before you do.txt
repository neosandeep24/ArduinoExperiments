Note : Each Sensor is different you have to calibrate for your own sensor
How ? First read the analog values(In arduino ide in the top right corner there is a search icon clicking that will give analog values) then write action based on that 
For example when i bend the flex sensor the analog value changed to > 850 so I added an action to it like light a bulb
If any code is not working please feel free to change it based on your need
ALL THE CODES ARE AVAILABLE IN ORDER IN THE SAME FILE ITSELF 1)BULB 2)Display 3)Bulb with Display 4)Bulbs with Display
