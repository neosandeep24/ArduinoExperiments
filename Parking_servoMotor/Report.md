# Automatic Gate opener

## Working
In this I have implemented a automatic tollgate system.
Detecting the car using ultrasonic sensor the arduino gives instruction to servo motor to rise the toll gate

## Components used :
1. Arduino
2. UltraSonic sensor
3. Servo Motor
4. Breadboard

## Circuit Connections:-

Ultrasonic sensor  ----  Arduino

      trigger pin  --- digital pin 6
      
      echo pin     --- digital pin 7
      
      Vcc          --- 5v 
      
      Gnd          --- Gnd

Servo motor 

    control signal  of servo motor (ORANGE)  -----   Digital pin Number 9 of arduino 
    
    vcc of servo motor (RED)                             -----   5v of arduino 
    
    GND of servo motor (BLACK)                      -----   GND of arduino
